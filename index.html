<p>Opening Mar 26th from 6pm.<br><br>
		LOOM is an ongoing series of 'weavings' created using python and photoshop. 
		Presented as prints, LOOM explores the demateralisation of making; the historical relationship between programmable looms and computer science; and the design approaches of the Bauhaus weaving workshop. 
		Drawing upon these lineages, LOOM positions the computer not only as a tool but as a site for making: as a communal workshop or personal studio, in and of itself.<br><br>
		Accompanying the exhibition is a catalogue of contextual writing by designer Rida Abbasi, activist and artist Tilde Joy, design researcher Ryley Lawson and the programmer of LOOM's python code, Bobby Ly. </p>
