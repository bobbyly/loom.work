LOOM was organised and held on the lands of the Wurundjeri and Boon Wurrung people of the Kulin Nation. Sovereignty over this land was never ceded. I pay respects to Elders past, present, and future.

LOOM was held at Tinning Street Presents from the 5th–21st of February, 2021. It was originally scheduled to open on the 26th of March, 2020. LOOM is an ongoing series of ‘weavings’ created using python automation and photoshop by Hope Lumsden-Barry. This body of work explores the dematerialisation of making and workspaces, the interconnected history of programming and weaving, and the design legacy of the Bauhaus weaving workshop.

The catalogue features original essays by Tilde Joy and Rida Abbasi. Rida writes about emergence and the role of the artist/designer in the history of generative art. Tilde writes about scabbing-as-activism in a world in which, for the benefit of a chosen few, humanity and the planet are wrung out for every possible cent of value until collapse. The catalogue also features two short contextual pieces by Bobby Ly and Ryley Lawson.
